# NLPDisaster

This notebook is made for Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets for Kaggle Competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started

# Methods and Models

We used text preprocessing in the notebook as well as different models (SVC, RandomForest, LogisticRegression, XGBClassifier, MultinomialNB) and built a voting classifier ensemble as well to see each model performs.

We also made use of a BERT model from PyTorch in order to see our how well we can perform with Transfer Learning.
